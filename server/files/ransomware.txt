Your files have been encrypted!

All of your important files, including documents, photos, videos, and databases, have been encrypted using a strong encryption algorithm. You cannot access your files unless you obtain the decryption key from us.

What happened to my files?
Your files have been locked using military-grade encryption. Attempting to recover them without our software will result in permanent data loss. Do not rename or modify encrypted files, as this may damage them.

How can I recover my files?
To decrypt your files, you need to follow these steps:

Download and install the Tor Browser from https://www.torproject.org.
Open the Tor Browser and go to our website:

Important:

You must contact us within 48 hours to receive a lower price. After this period, the ransom will double.
If you fail to pay within 7 days, your files will be permanently lost.
Do not attempt to remove or disable this software; doing so may result in complete data loss.
Warning!
We are the only ones who can decrypt your files. Any attempts to recover your data using third-party software will result in corruption and loss of your files permanently.
